# Generation-of-Synthetic-Echocardiograms-Using-Video-Diffusion-Models
<TOC>

This repository contains the code used and implemented during the development of the final thesis

  To see synthetic samples generated by our model visit https://alexolpe.github.io/final-thesis/index.html


## Environment configuration

The codes are based on python3.7+, CUDA version 11.0+. The specific configuration steps are as follows:

1. Create conda environment
   
   ```shell
   conda create -n idm python=3.7.10
   conda activate idm
   ```

2. Install pytorch
   
   ```shell
   conda install pytorch==1.11.0 torchvision==0.12.0 torchaudio==0.11.0 cudatoolkit=11.3
   ```

3. Installation profile
   
   ```shell
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   python setup.py develop
   ```
## Pre-trained checkpoint

The pre-trained checkpoint and the val dataset of face 8X SR can be found at the following anonymous link: [link](https://1drv.ms/u/s!AraiW_uJqO8vhnlIa-8nd0PEH4Ur?e=qDfSep). Download and unzip `checkpoint_dataset.zip`. Move `checkpoint_dataset/best_psnr_gen.pth` and `checkpoint_dataset/dataset` to `./`.

## Validation
Run the following command for the validation:

   ```shell
   sh run.sh
   ```
